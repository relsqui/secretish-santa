## Features

- The organizer doesn't have to see the matches, so they can participate without ruining the surprise.
- Doesn't require contact information, just write down the names and get a link to give each person to view their recipient.
- You can include addresses or other info alongside the names if you want to. Everything on the line will be shown on the secret link page. (The links will be much longer if you do this, but they're also padded so you can't use the length to guess who the encoded recipient is.)

## Not features

- It doesn't _prevent_ the organizer from seeing the assignments, it just doesn't force them to. Hence "secret-ish."
- If the organizer doesn't save the list of secret links, they're gone forever.
- No CSS was harmed in the making of this website. (If you hate that, send me a pull request.)
